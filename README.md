# Basics of Python Course
This repository contains the course materials for the "Basics of Python" course taught in October 2023 to psychology and neuroscience master students in the General Psychology department of the University of Padova. The course was designed to introduce non-programmers to the basics of Python programming language in 20 hours.

The course materials include:
1. Two Google Colab files with code examples and exercises to help students learn Python fundamentals.
2. Two Google Colabe files that provide answers to the exercises (Obviously, the provided answers are not the only answer or even necessarily the efficient answer. So any more and better answers you share with me can help everyone. Thank you in advance for your help in improving the answers.)
3. A fake dataset (bmi.csv) is necessary for almost all exercises.

Whether you are a beginner or have some programming experience, this repository can be a great resource to help you learn Python. I hope that you find this repository useful and that it helps you achieve your programming goals. Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding your own code examples, fixing bugs, or suggesting improvements. Happy coding!
